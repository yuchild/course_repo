# Welcome 

Welcome to the Galvanize Data Science Immersive Program.  On this page, you'll find all the information you need to know about the day to day activities in the program.

# Course Outline
This is the outline for the course.  Each row represents a day, readings are to be completed before class on the given day.

The [nighly readings](notes/readings.md) are maintained in a separate file.  Many students find it useful to read ahead a bit on the weekends.

* __Day:__ Day of the Week
* __Repo:__ The repo contains the day's exercise(s). You should be able to complete this in the time allotted (you will not have access until the day of).
* __Lead Instructor:__ The instructor who is the point person for the day.

## Weekly Structure
During all instructional weeks, every Monday will begin with an assessment.  Assessments are the primary mechanism instructors have to ensure that the material is being absorbed.  The assessments primarily focus on the material from the previous week.

During instructional weeks, every Friday will be a capstone where the material that had been covered during the week will be put to use in a more open ended application of the knowledge.

## Capstones
Capstone projects are designed to be showcases of the diverse skill set that you aquire over this challenging course of study.  In addition to building machine learnign models, capstones should feature fundamental skills like data collection and cleaning (which employers find very attractive).

## Textbooks
We will focus on a few canonical texts for the class and readings will be assigned from them. If they are not in a physical form in our library, they are located in digital form on the Time Capsule or the Internet.
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf): The book we use for the majority of machine learning readings.
* [Machine Learning In Action](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1cm3fV8cnJwcUNWWnFaRWgwTDA/view?usp=sharing): 

### Supplementary
* [Doing Data Science](http://www.amazon.com/Doing-Data-Science-Straight-Frontline/dp/1449358659): One of the best treatments of the field with plenty of case studies.
* [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do): Some of the `pandas` methods have changed (always reference `pandas` [online documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/)) but a solid book on data analysis in Python.
* [Practical Data Science with R](http://www.manning.com/zumel/): through we will not use R, this is a stellar book and we will use it for its content/theory
