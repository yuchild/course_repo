# Welcome 

Welcome to the Galvanize Data Science Immersive Program!  On this page you'll find information you about the program as a whole as well as links to daily readings and assignments.  You'll be working with this page everyday - please bookmark it in your web browser. 

# Weekly overview
The Data Science Immersive (DSI) has 8 instructional weeks, 3 capstone weeks, and the final showcase week.  Most instructional weeks begin with a 1 hour assessment on Monday and end with a group case study on Friday. 

The capstone weeks are reserved for your capstone projects (see below).  You will scrum with your peers during this time, participate in mock job interiews, and at the end of the week present your project to either your peers and instructors (capstones 1 & 2), or the data science community in the capstone showcase (capstone 3).

The final week is reserved for finishing your capstone, completing Career Services deliverables, presenting at the capstone showcase, and graduating.

## Other important links
* [Daily Readings](./notes/readings.md) The assigned readings are intended to prepare you for the lectures and assignments that day.  Allocate about 30 minutes for each reading, though some are also references and are more extensive.  Only the **bolded** readings are required for that day.
* [Solutions repo](https://github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/solutions-g99)  Solutions for the daily assignments, weekly reviews, and assessments will be added to this repository.  If a solution is missing, please bug an instructor!
* [Weekly feedback](https://forms.gle/FKQkpa8Wb5CTT9nL9) Every Friday you'll be given some time to reflect on the week and be given a chance to let us know how you're doing.  Then let us know how well you think we taught the material.  We'll use your contstructive criticism to adapt as the course proceeds.
* [Past student projects](https://github.com/gSchool/dsi-project-proposals/blob/master/past_student_projects.md)  Whether you're looking for capstone ideas or resources to help you with your current capstone, take a look here.  The instructor voted most exemplary/helpful ones are marked with an astericks.


## Capstone Project
Capstone projects allow you to put in to practice some of the knowledge you are gaining in the program on projects of your choosing.  They help build your Github portfolio, and give you specific skills to talk about during job interviews.You will submit capstone proposals to the instructors for approval before the capstone weeks begin.  Very often capstone 3 builds on work done on capstone 2, and sometimes even capstone 1.

## Textbooks
We will focus on a few canonical texts for the class and readings will be assigned from them. If they are not in a physical form in our library, they are located in digital form on the Time Capsule or the Internet.
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf): The book we use for the majority of machine learning readings.
* [Machine Learning In Action](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1cm3fV8cnJwcUNWWnFaRWgwTDA/view?usp=sharing): 

### Supplementary
* [Doing Data Science](http://www.amazon.com/Doing-Data-Science-Straight-Frontline/dp/1449358659): One of the best treatments of the field with plenty of case studies.
* [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do): Some of the `pandas` methods have changed (always reference `pandas` [online documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/)) but a solid book on data analysis in Python.
* [Practical Data Science with R](http://www.manning.com/zumel/): through we will not use R, this is a stellar book and we will use it for its content/theory

## Getting Help
* [Data Science Stack Exchange](http://datascience.stackexchange.com/)
* [Stats Stack Exchange](http://stats.stackexchange.com/)
* [MetaOptimize: ML and Datascience forum](http://metaoptimize.com/qa)
