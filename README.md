# Welcome 

Welcome to the Galvanize Data Science Immersive Program! On this page you'll find information you about the program as a whole as well as links to daily readings and assignments. You'll be working with this page everyday; please bookmark it in your web browser.

# Course Outline
The Data Science Immersive (DSI) has 8 instructional weeks, 3 capstone weeks, and the final showcase/career week. Most instructional weeks begin with a 1 hour assessment on Monday and end with a group case study on Friday.

The capstone weeks are reserved for your capstone projects (see below). You will scrum with your peers during this time, participate in mock job interiews, and at the end of the week present your project to your peers and instructors (capstones 1 & 2), or to the data science community on a demo day (capstone 3).

The final week is reserved for capstone III, demo day, completing Career Services deliverables, mock interviews, and graduating.

* [Morning Warmups](https://github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/morning-warmups).
* [Solutions](https://github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/solutions-g106) for warmups, assignments, and assessments will be added to this repository.  If a solution is missing, please bug an instructor!
* [Weekly feedback](TBF) Every Friday you'll be given some time to reflect on the week and be given a chance to let us know how you're doing.  Then let us know how well you think we taught the material.  We'll use your contstructive criticism to adapt as the course proceeds.
* [Past student capstone projects](https://github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/project-proposals/blob/master/past_student_projects.md) Whether you're looking for capstone ideas or resources to help you with your current capstone, take a look here.  The instructor voted most exemplary/helpful ones are marked with an astericks.
* [Lectures](https://github.com/GalvanizeDataScience/lectures/tree/LA) Lectures for each day can be found in the lectures repo of the same name.  Clone (don't Fork) this repo.  Then be sure you checkout the Denver branch.

## Capstone Project
Capstone projects allow you to put into practice some of the knowledge you are gaining in the program on projects of your choosing.  They help build your Github portfolio, and give you specific skills to talk about during job interviews. You will submit capstone proposals to the instructors for approval before the capstone weeks begin. Very often capstone 3 builds on work done on capstone 2, and sometimes even capstone 1.

## Textbooks
We will focus on a few canonical texts for the class and readings will be assigned from them. If they are not in a physical form in our library, they are located in digital form on the Time Capsule or the Internet.
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf): The book we use for the majority of machine learning readings.
* [Machine Learning In Action](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1cm3fV8cnJwcUNWWnFaRWgwTDA/view?usp=sharing): 

### Supplementary
* [Doing Data Science](http://www.amazon.com/Doing-Data-Science-Straight-Frontline/dp/1449358659): One of the best treatments of the field with plenty of case studies.
* [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do): Some of the `pandas` methods have changed (always reference `pandas` [online documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/)) but a solid book on data analysis in Python.
* [Practical Data Science with R](http://www.manning.com/zumel/): through we will not use R, this is a stellar book and we will use it for its content/theory

## Getting Help
