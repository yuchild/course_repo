# Pair Programming

Pair programming is a common practice in the software development community and
can also be an excellent way to learn a new subject. Many of the coding
exercises you do here at Galvanize will be with a partner, and this document is to
help you understand how to pair effectively.

## Summary

* One driver, one navigator, one program
* Always be respectful
* Keep up a steady flow of discussion with your partner
* Switch roles every 20-30 minutes; use the `countdown` timer

## One pair, one program

**The most important thing to keep in mind is that you and your partner are
developing together on a single program.** You are to explore, discuss, and
navigate the problem space together. Traditionally, a single pair uses only a
single mouse, keyboard, and screen to enforce this collaboration; here at
Galvanize we have a mouse, keyboard, and screen for both partners in a pair, but
the spirit of collaboration should be the same.

Pairing can be a phenomally effective structure for developing code and learning
new subjects. Give it your full effort and remember to always be respectful
toward your partner.

## Driving and Navigating

At any given time, one partner is on the keyboard (the driver) and the other
partner (the navigator) is discussing approaches, pointing out missteps or typos, and generally
supporting the driver. *There should be a steady flow of discussion while
developing.*

**Every 20-30 minutes, the driver and navigator roles will switch.** Use the
`countdown` utility in the Terminal to keep time. It will display a Mac OS X
notification when time is up.

*iTerm:*

```
$ countdown 25
Countdown started: 25 minutes
[1] 37336

$
```

If you don't have countdown on your computer, you can search **Google for 'countdown'** and use the result for notification.
