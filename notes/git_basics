# Intro to Git and GitHub

## Background 

GitHub is one of the most popular tools for people to develop software collaboratively via the Internet. At the heart of GitHub is Git, a distributed version control system for software development. It allows us to keep track of and manage all of the different versions of our files for a project. It does this by keeping a history of all of the changes that we make to our files. When used correctly, Git also works as a backup of our files: it allows us to keep a backup copy of our work on GitHub, and it allows us to roll back any of our files to any previous version that we have *committed* to the repo.

While Git is a distributed version control system, GitHub is a hosting service for Git *repos* (repositories for software projects). In other words, GitHub is a hosting service for projects that use Git. GitHub allows us to share our projects with other people, and to allow other people to collaborate with us on our projects either privately or publicly. We interact with Git locally on our computers through our `bash` terminal, whereas we interact with GitHub through a web browser.

### Diving In

Before we can work and interact with a Git repository (either locally or 
through GitHub), we first have to obtain a Git repository! First, we'll make a local copy of a Git repo by cloning it from GitHub. Then we'll use `git` commands to interact with the repo. 

#### What's a repo, anyway?

A Git repository is a **local** collection of files and contains a hidden `.git` 
subdirectory in its root. Git keeps track of the state of the files in the 
repository's directory on disk (so long as those files have been added to the index - we'll get to that below). There are two different ways to create a new repository: 

* Initializing an empty, new local repository (*not* recommended)
* *Cloning* a repository from GitHub (highly recommended)

At Galvanize, you can expect to use the second method exclusively: *cloning* a repository from GitHub. So, if you're starting a new project, don't try to initialize it locally. The best workflow is to create an empty repo on GitHub first, then clone the GitHub repo to your computer to start your work.

#### Cloning a Git Repo

The process of copying a Git repo from GitHub to your computer is called *cloning*. To clone a repository, we simply issue the `git clone` command followed by a URL.

The syntax looks like this:

##### Using https:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/$USERNAME/$REPO_NAME
```

##### Using ssh (preferred, but requires [setup](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/))
```bash
git clone git@github.com:$USERNAME/$REPO_NAME
```

Of course, you need to fill in the actual values above:
 * Replace $USERNAME with a GitHub username
 * Repalce $REPO_NAME with an actual repo name

The URL that you copy an existing repository from will almost always be the URL of somebody's repo on GitHub (or your own repo on GitHub). Directions for how to create your own repository on GitHub (that you then clone to your local machine) can be found here: [https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/)


#### Interacting with a Git Repository

Now that we have a Git repository, we can start working in that repository 
(directory), and have Git keep track of the changes that we are making to 
any of the files in our repo. The standard workflow within a Git repository 
is that you will change one or more files in the repository, possibly review
the changes, add them to the *index* (a file that Git uses to keep track of 
tracked files), and then create a new commit with those changes. Let's look
at some commands, and then we'll go into a little bit more detail about how
this all works. 

The following are all commands that we would issue on the command line from 
within our Git repository. Note that any time we issue a Git command, it 
will be prefixed by `git`. 

```bash
git status  # Do this EARLY and OFTEN. Red = bad, fix it!
git add foo.txt  # Add the file foo.txt to the staging area (green). 
git add bar/  # Add the folder bar/ (and all its contents).
git commit -m 'Add foo and bar.'  # Commit all staged items.
```

I've mentioned the *index* above, and while understanding it isn't necessary, it can help us to understand exactly how Git works. The *index* (which is hidden in the .git subdirectory of any Git repository) keeps track of all files that the Git repository is actually responsible for tracking. The `git add` command above will put files into the staging area. Once the file is committed with `git commit`, `git status` will only note *changes* to the file (i.e. what's different from the last time it was committed).

If you see something in *red* in `git status`, think of this as seeing "blood" on your repo. The goal is to fix it immediately. You do this by *adding* and *committing* your changes. It does NOT matter whether your code is working or "finished" because you can always commit additional changes later! Commit early and often to your repo.

Remember, *A.B.C.*: Always Be Committing.


### Working with a Cloned Repository 

Now that we know how to clone a repository, it's time to talk about pushing
and pulling, the process by which we keep a remote copy of our repository (on GitHub) 
up to date and in sync with a local copy of our repository (and vice versa). 
Anytime that we have cloned a repository from a URL, the repository at that 
URL will become the *remote* copy of that repository. *Pulling* is the way that 
we will keep our local copy of the repository up to date with any changes made 
by others to the *remote*, and *pushing* is the way that we will keep 
the *remote* up to date with changes we have made locally.

Note that you will  have to have write access to the remote repo in order to be able to push your changes to it directly. 

You can see your *remotes* at any time:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Pushing and pulling only work properly when all changes have been *committed*. This means that if you  have made changes to a repository, but not gone through the process of *adding* and *committing* them, then issuing the push commands below will 
not actually push any changes to the remote repository. Similarly, if there have been 
no changes to the remote repository since you last issued a pull, then issuing 
the pull commands below will not actually pull anything.

**If you see blood in your `git status`, fix that *first* before running any other git commands.**

To push and pull: 

```bash 
git push  # Update the remote repo with new local commits from your computer. 
git pull  # Update the local repo on your computer with new commits from the remote.
```


Note that `git push` is normally short for `git push origin master` (push to the `master` branch on the remote called `origin`) and, similarly, `git pull` is short for `git pull origin master`.

### Forking

*Forking* is kind of like *cloning*, but there are two important distinctions: 

* *Forking* occurs only on GitHub, and is specific to GitHub (i.e. you can't 
*fork* on your local machine - it's not an option). 
* *Forking* creates your own personalized copy of the repo on your GitHub account. Now, if you would like to make changes, you would clone your forked repository. Even if you don't have write access to the original repo, you can push new commits directly to your *fork* of the original repo.
* A *pull request* is a request *by you* for the owner of a repo to *pull* changes from your fork of that repo (and incorporate them into the original). Pull requests are useful for open-source projects, where anyone can propose changes and contribute code, but these proposed changes need to be reviewed and approved by the project owners before they get merged into the original project.
