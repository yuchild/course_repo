# DSI Capstone III guide

Capstone III is what you present at the capstone showcase.  For most, it's
a continuation of Capstone II.  Besides making your Capstone II model better,
Capstone III could feature:  
* improvements in deployment (creation of a Docker image)  
* improvements in a user interface (a Flask web application hosted on AWS)  
* more streamlined, better commented, object-oriented, refactored code 
* evidence of test-driven-development: a `tests` directory with a test suite that tests all or some parts of your code  
* scale-up of the project to train on big data in the cloud with a powerful instance  
* comparison of results from a big data tool (e.g. Spark) on a big data dataset compared to a model trained in sklearn on a much smaller dataset  

If you decide to change projects between Capstones II and III, please consider 
this cautionary image describing the project Valley of Despair:

If Capstone II worked out for you, there's a good chance you've pushed through 
the "4) Why am I here" stage and got to "5) First win."  If you continued working 
on Capstone II for Capstone III, it would be on the up-and-up to "6) New levels achieved"
and beyond.  If you're starting a new project for Capstone III, you're back to the 
beginning and you've got to navigate the Valley of Despair again!  

If you _still_ want to change projects, you'll need to submit a new project proposal (**if you
aren't changing projects, a Capstone III project proposal isn't required.**)  For your 
Capstone III proposal to be successful, we'll want to see significant progress on
the project already (you've parsed the data, provide EDA, maybe even preliminary results).
You only have about a week to work on it, after all. 


## Capstone III goals

* An MVP+ or MVP++ that demonstrates advanced skill in supervised or unsupervised learning (and maybe both).
* A professional Github containing your project's code, with a Readme that describes your project at an advanced level.  Here are a few examples of impressive final project Readmes:  
  * a  
  * b
  * c
* A professional poster or talk describing the project. Here is  

## Capstone III proposal  

This is **not required* if you are expanding on your Capstone II project.  

Please write up a Capstone III proposal and submit it to your instructors for
review.  Please submit a **one to two page PDF** file (no text files, markdowns, or 
Word Documents).

The proposal should:

1) State your question.  What is it that you are curious about?  What are you looking 
for in the data?

2) Demonstrate that you have looked at your data.  What are your columns?  Are they
numerical/catagorical?  How many Nan's are there?  Have you made a couple of plots? 
We only have a week for this capstone. It's very hard to do a good capstone when 
you've only had the real dataset for a couple of days.  This can make it challenging to 
work with a company.  Their timescale is different from the DSI.  "Fast" for them is a 
couple of weeks.  You needed the dataset yesterday.

3) State your MVP.  MVP is your Minimum Viable Product.  What's the minimum that you 
hope to accomplish?  Then, feel free to expand on MVP+, and MVP++.  

## Evaluation  
This capstone should help you get a job!  Your Github's code, Readme, and your
talk/poster should all be ready to land that first job interview.
