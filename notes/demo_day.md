# Demo Day

This is where you'll be showcasing your work. Itâ€™s like a science fair, but for capstones. 

There's food! 

Bring guests! You'll be giving presentations the whole time. Please set their expectations accordingly.

Arriving at 8:30 not required, just a couple hours before it begins, please. 


This will be the whole invite:

    Please share this invite with your family and friends that would be interested in attending your capstone demo day. It's important that all guests RSVP so we can get a good estimate of how much food and refreshments to order.
