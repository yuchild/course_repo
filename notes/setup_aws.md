## Setting Up Amazon Web Services (AWS)

This course we will be using Amazon cloud computing services (AWS). Follow the instructions below to set up your account and claim the free credit that is available to you.

## Part 1: Create an AWS account

Go to [http://aws.amazon.com/](http://aws.amazon.com/) and sign up: 

- You may sign in using your existing Amazon account or you can create a new account by selecting
  **Create a free account** using the button at the right, then selecting **I am a new user**.
    
- Enter your contact information and confirm your acceptance of the AWS Customer Agreement.

- Once you have created an Amazon Web Services Account, you may need to accept a telephone call to verify your identity. Some people have used Google Voice successfully if you don't have or don't want to give a mobile number.
      
- Once you have an account, go to [http://aws.amazon.com/](http://aws.amazon.com/) and sign in. You will work primarily from the Amazon Management Console.

## Part 2: Activate your AWS free credit

As a Galvanize member, you are entitled to some free Amazon Web Services credits that may be useful for your capstone projects. Follow the steps below to activate your credits. Credits typically arrive in your AWS account 2-4 weeks after your application. You will not necessarily receive an e-mail from AWS when your credits post to your account, so don't hesitate to log in and check if you're curious.

Go to [http://aws.amazon.com/activate/portfolio-signup/](http://aws.amazon.com/activate/portfolio-signup/) and fill in your details. Make sure the name and email address match your AWS account e-mail information exactly.
