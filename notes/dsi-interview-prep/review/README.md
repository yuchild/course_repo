# Review

These are two excellent resources:

* **[Model Comparison Guide](Model_Comparison_Guide.md)**
* **[Review Slides](ReviewSlides.pdf)**

#### Most Important Topics

It's hard to know what to expect in interviews, so we've highlighted topics that we've found students are most commonly asked about. Of course anything is fair game, so it doesn't hurt to review any material that you feel like you missed.

* Python programming
* SQL
* Runtime Analysis: We'll go over this during interview prep, but here are some [notes](../runtime_notes)
* Probability 
* Frequentist A/B testing 
* Cross Validation 
* Scoring metrics: precision/recall, confusion matrix.
* Cost functions: RSS, RMSE, absolute error.
* Model Comparison: [Model Comparison Guide](Model_Comparison_Guide.md).
* Recommenders 
* Different distance functions
* Whatever you used on your project!
