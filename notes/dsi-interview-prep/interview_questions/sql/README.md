# SQL

These are often in one of two forms:

* Given these tables, write a query to do blah.
* Tell me the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, CROSS JOIN.

#### Practice

* Redo the [sql exercise](https://github.com/gschool/dsi-sql). Go through all the extra credit!
* Do these [example interview SQL problems](sql_qs.md).
