# Types of Data Science Interview Questions

1. **[Takehome Challenges](takehomes):** Often the first step of the interview process is a takehome, where they send you a dataset and a prompt. Your job is to do some analysis or modeling, answer some questions, and send them back your code along with an explanation. These are similar to case studies.
2. **[Coding Interviews (Whiteboarding)](coding):** For coding interviews, you often will have to write code on the board. Typically they will let you use your language of choice. You all did one of these when you interviewed for Galvanize!
3. **[SQL](sql):** For companies who use SQL to store their data (which is quite a few of them!), they will be looking for candidates who are comfortable writing SQL queries.
4. **[Probability & Statistics Questions](prob-stats-ml):** Questions involving counting, Bayes Theorem, distributions, etc.
5. **[Machine Learning Algorithms](prob-stats-ml):** Can you explain the algorithms at a high level?
6. **[Business Analytics & Case Studies](https://github.com/gschool/dsi-business-analytics/):** Open ended questions where you need to brainstorm how to apply data science so solve a real business problem.
