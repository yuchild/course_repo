There are 2 CSV files in this folder that have data representing a reward offers
and reward redemptions.

## Tasks
--------

There are 2 tasks:

1. Collect metrics of interest.
2. Offer insights for how we could improve [Cost Per Thousand Impressions (CPM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_impression).

The first task requires specific metrics collection:
Find the conversion rate and CPM per campaign within each application. Include all of the code you need to transform and calculate the data.

The second goal is more of an open ended question and involves writing about your methods and reasoning:
Given the data that was collected in the first task, what are some metrics we can calculate to give us insights as to how to improve CPM? For this second question, if you don't have enough data or would like to have additional data, please specify the format of the data(the columns in each file) that you would like to have and desscribe your transformations to acquire the information that you need.

## Tools
#### Pandas or R is preferred.
