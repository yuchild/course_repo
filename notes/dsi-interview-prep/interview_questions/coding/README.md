# Whiteboarding

1. **Review Runtime Analysis.** When coding on the board, your interviewer may ask you to analyze the runtime of your algorithm.
    * [Runtime analysis notes](../../runtime_notes/runtime_analysis.md).
    * [Runtime analysis demonstration](../../runtime_notes/runtime_analysis_demonstration.ipynb).
2. **Practice Whiteboarding Questions.** Make sure to practice writing your code out by hand without executing anything!
    * Here is a [bank of programming questions](coding_questions_1.md) best for whiteboarding practice.
    * Here are some [slightly more involved coding questions](coding_questions_2.ipynb) (with links to some review material)
    * The website [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) has endless example problems.
    * We have a copy of [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) in our library.
