# Deliverables Due By Friday(5/31) at 5p


## 1) Slide deck with 6 slides:


**Slide 1**

**Slide 6**
+ Conclusion and next steps
  * What did you learn about your data?

## 2. Github Repository with the following Requirements:
+ 1 - 3 page github Readme with above information included
+ Outline the process for the data pipeline
+ Multiple Data Visualizations
+ Outline Hypothesis Tests and results
+ Notebook containing EDA
+ Title that is NOT ‘Capstone 1’

#### Recommended but not required:
[Medium](https://medium.com/topic/data-science) article, [imgur gallery](https://imgur.com/a/Qjqge13) submitted to Reddit, Jupyter notebook,, YouTube explainer, etc.


**Stretch Goal** Demonstate your understanding of concept covered so far. Choose from:
  * Probability: State a hypothesis and perform a hypothesis test.
  * Probability: Estimate the parameters of a distribution.
  * Linear algebra: Invert a matrix to solve a problem
  * Linear algebra: express a quantity in terms of a linear combination of a new basis of your own choice.
    * (technically this is "dimensionality reduction", which we'll cover later)
  * Do something fancy with the tooolchain. (e.g., Set up a Spark cluster on several AWS machines and sort a gigantic list sitting in an S3 bucket).
